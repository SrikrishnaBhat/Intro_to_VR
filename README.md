## Project Setup guide
************************************************************************************************************************

Hello Everyone! Welcome to the first workshop. As part of the workshop there are a few dependencies and software
installations that need to be completed. This setup guide is intended to guide you through it.

The following are the major dependencies for the project:
1. Unity Hub
2. Unity Editor version 2020.3.31f1
3. VR Builder asset

For testing your project with Oculus devices which will be the VR headset of our choice, the following pre-requisites
will be necessary:
1. Oculus device needs to be in Developer mode. Documentation on doing this can be found here:
https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/
2. Oculus Link needs to be set up to debug and playtest your changes in the device. 

## Dependency installation

3. From the list shown go to 2020.X tab and install the 2020.3.31f1 version. Note: As long as it is 2020.3.X version,
it should be fine. The fix-pack versions aren't as crucial, but try to not keep it too faraway from version 31 of the fix-pack version.
